# dog_classifier

## Setup

You will also need to have a GPU on your machine and configured. To set things up, you'll need to install [GPU support for tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu). Or use Google's Colaboratory!

## Data
Created with tensorflow and keras

You'll need to download the dog image dataset to follow this project:

* [dog_images.zip](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1sj62C-9WKD09-8iYSeEvXmAGQoY2oFFQ) - please unzip this file into a folder called images.

The data is originally from [Stanford](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). The original dataset has many more breeds included, which you can use to extend your analysis.
